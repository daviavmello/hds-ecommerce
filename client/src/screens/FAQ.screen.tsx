          What is included with a remodeling estimate?
        </h4>
        <p className="text-justify">
          Our free remodeling estimates include a detailed written scope of
          work. At times, when necessary or when requested, we will provide
          renderings for you to view what your remodel will look like upon
          completion. Renderings look like a picture of your home and are a
          likeness of what your remodel will look like so you can visualize the
          space to be remodeled.

          Will I need to pay for a design agreement?
        </h4>
        <p className="text-justify">
          Most kitchen and bathroom remodels are contracted without a design
          agreement. Design agreements are most typically used for major
          renovations of multiple rooms (such as a whole house remodel) or home
          addition projects.

          What is the difference between an estimate and a design agreement?
        </h4>
        <p className="text-justify">
          An estimate is free and is an educated price that is prepared for your
          project. A design agreement means you chose to select Classic Home
          Improvements as your builder but you are not quite sure yet on the
          design you want to build.

          How long will my project take?

        <p className="text-justify">
          During our free consultation with you, we will discuss the duration of
          your project. The key element in completing your project in a timely
          manner is for you to be available during the process so you can select
          your products.

        <p className="text-justify">
          We employ both subcontractors and hourly employees who are on our
          payroll. The subcontractors we work with have all worked with us for
          several years and for most of them, we are their sole source of
          employment because we are able to keep them busy from one job to the
          next.

          Will there be a big mess during our project?

        <p className="text-justify">
          Construction is messy. It is dirty and dusty. Before it is beautiful,
          it is a construction zone. However, we respect your property by laying
          down clean tarps as needed and cleaning the work space and traffic
          areas daily.
